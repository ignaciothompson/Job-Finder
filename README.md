This is my first app with React native.

This app will allow you to search the JSearch API in RapidAPI (https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch), you will be able to search for specific jobs, filter by types (Full-Time, Part-time, Contractor) and if the job is still available you will be able to apply.

You can access the app here https://shorturl.at/ghjU4 by using the expo app


> :warning: **Since this is my first app, I cant afford to pay the API so if you enter and nothing shows is beacouse I ran out of entries**
