This is my first app with React native.

This app will allow you to search the JSearch API in RapidAPI (https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch), you will be able to search for specific jobs, filter by types (Full-Time, Part-time, Contractor) and if the job is still available you will be able to apply.

You can access the app here [https://expo.dev/preview/update?message=Change%20of%20the%20default%20user%20image&updateRuntimeVersion=1.0.0&createdAt=2024-04-08T19%3A13%3A48.218Z&slug=React-jobs&projectId=8aed0672-76d4-4ae5-8b7c-a5661d05114d&group=b2a3ed3d-3d5f-4e0a-94ad-4cec82f5c42a](https://shorturl.at/IMNOP) by using the expo app


> :warning: **Since this is my first app, I cant afford to pay the API so if you enter and nothing shows is beacouse I ran out of entries**
